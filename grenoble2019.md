# Notes from running a livestream during the ZX workshop, Grenoble 25-26 February 2019


The stream:

- The livestream was broadcast via the open ZX Google Hangout at
https://hangouts.google.com/call/pk4lfcfxx5avtj5jrb36e5e3aue?no_rd

- Anyone with the URL could access the Hangout (as long as they were signed into Google). The URL was distributed on the conference scratch website, and via the ZX mailing list a few days in advance.

- The "workshop account" (in practice the account of the organiser) left the Hangout at breaks and lunchtime, transmitting only during the sessions.


The set-up:

- The main broadcasting computer was a 2018 MacBook Pro. Older computers were occasionally used and handled the stream fine. Despite initial worries, there was no problem with the laptop overheating or getting slow.

- An external webcam was plugged into the laptop, and set up on a table in front of where the speakers stood to give their talks. This meant the microphone was close to the speakers, and there was no issue with sound once the settings on the Hangout had been switched to capture sound from the webcam (this did not happen automatically like the video settings did).

- One person (generally the session chair, which in this case was the organiser) sat to the side at the front, with laptop at right angles to the speaker, at the end of the webcam wire and monitored the livestream for technical issues, checked that the speaker was in frame, and took any questions from the livestream chat. This worked well. The streaming laptop screen wasn't visible to either the speaker or the audience, so did not distract.

There were three types of session, all with slightly different set-ups.

1. Talks with slides.

  - The webcam was pointed at the speaker, who was told where the field of view of the camera was and requested not to wander out of it. Speakers generally took this in their stride (or at least didn't appear visibly to be put off). The speaker's laptop was also connected to the Hangout and they shared their screen. This meant people on the Hangout could chose to full-screen either the slides or the picture of the speaker.

  - Dealing with audio feedback was an important issue. The full solutions on each laptop were the following:

    - Chair's laptop: connected to webcam, video and microphone set to capture from webcam, speakers on.

    - Speakers' laptop: connect to projector. Mute speakers before entering the Hangout. Once in, immediately mute microphone. Share screen (sometimes sharing only the application caused the Hangout to crash so generally 'share entire screen' was preferred). Then start slides as usual for a presentation.

  - Questions: sometimes the livestream could not hear questions from the audience. Asking the speaker to repeat any questions solved that. For questions from the livestream, either the chair read out questions written into the chat, or else livestream attendees unmuted their microphones and asked through the chair's laptop. It worked quite well to turn the laptop around to the speaker so they could see the video of the person asking the question. There was a direct line of sight between the speaker, the webcam, and the chair+laptop.

2. Talks on the whiteboard.

  - Again the webcam was pointed at the speaker. This time, only the webcam image and sound was broadcast. This worked less well than slides talks. Challenges included getting the speaker to write large enough for the livestream to read, and to move the webcam around mid-talk to make sure the speaker and board were always in shot.

  - In general, the whiteboard did not come over well on the webcam, and almost all detail was lost.

  - One possible solution in future is to have a second person broadcasting from the speaker's location, who is copying the contents of the whiteboard onto their own laptop (eg using a digital pen) and sharing their screen.

3. Discussion sessions.

  - For these sessions the livestream was projected onto the main screen, and the webcam positioned in front of it pointing at the audience. This enabled two-way communication and involvement of the livestream participants. If auto-switching of the livestream was disabled, someone (eg the chair) needed to manually click on whichever livestream person was speaking in order to put them into the main window. This seemed to work well and the audio in both directions enabled reasonably free discussions.



Comments:

- Having the livestream increased the participation importantly, for minimal cost. It seemed to integrate well, and speaking as the person chiefly responsibly for running it, it required minimal faffing.

- Next time, I would have a rota of different people monitoring the livestream, not just the same person (me) all the time.

- It would be good to find a way of giving general announcements in the livestream that people see when they join. E.g "we are running 20 mins behind schedule".

- Note that people join the livestream in different timezones, so announcements are better as "we will reconvene after lunch in 1 hour" rather than "at 1pm".


Final comment:

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that we move to make livestreaming a normal part of workshops within the community.
